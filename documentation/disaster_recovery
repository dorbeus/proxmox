What you should know before you start:
	Where are backups stored?
		network backups: liverpool.cs.uchicago.edu
			all backups are stored here.

		local per node backups: on sdb1 -> /backup
			The only backups stored here are the backups of the hosts on the particular node.
			OR... any host that was at one point stored on this node.

Recovering from one node failure:

1.) Find out which nodes need to be restored.

function on rserver:
proxmox () 
{ 
    for n in manchester chelsea arsenal astonvilla
    do
        echo $n;
        ssh -oBatchMode=yes $n "PATH=\$PATH:/opt/techstaff/bin; $1";
    done
}

Run this command from 'rserver': 
	proxmox 'vzlist && qm list'

This will show you the CTID and VMIDs (here CTID and VMID are essentially the same thing) of all hosts that rserver can ssh into.
So in theory a hosed system will not display its nodes.

Create a list of the nodes you need to restore. You only need the VMID of the node you wish to restore.
Which should be all the IDs that dont exist in the list of running VMs. These can be found on the
network backup server.

Either setup a new node and add it to the cluster or use and existing node and you can start restoring
all the VMs via the gui. You don't need to wait for each backup to complete to restore the next one. 
Just hit the X and restore the next one. Each request will be added to a queue and be restored in order.

If you are lucky enough to have an email from the previous day of a list of hosts running on the node
that failed you can make this very easy. :)

Given this output from the email:
