This document describes all the moving parts of the Proxmox setup.

Proxmox is a virtualization hypervisor, much like vmware esxi or xen server.
It is a minimal build of debian squeeze with a custom kernel that integrates openvz.
A web interface (https://IP:8006) can be used to manage all of your virtual machines.
Openvz and KVM are two virtualization services that Proxmox supports. So you can run
the same types of VMs using KVM that you may be used to on VMWare or Xen using KVM.

Proxmox's and openvz's forums are an OK resource for obtaining answers to questions.
Normally, a quick google search is sufficient to find simple solutions. Though, anything
outside of the general scope of knowledge and you will be on your own to find it out.
Your first step should be to consult these documents. These should answer most of your
questions.


# What is OpenVZ?
OpenVZ is a directory that contains the files for a complete operating system, minus
the kernel. When an OpenVZ container runs it uses the kernel from the Proxmox server.
As you may already realize, this allows each virtual machine to have an extremely small
footprint. You could potentially have hundreds of OpenVZ containers running on one server.

With OpenVZ there are a few things to be aware of: As I already stated, it does not have its
own kernel, so if you need a specific kernel use KVM. It also imports /dev from the host and
does not always do so properly. I believe I have fixed this by building a Ubuntu 12.04 template
from scratch.

# What is KVM?
Seriously? ;)
See any other virtualiztion software. The hard drive is a file of a certain size. Usually, it is
a VMDK, vdi, hdd, or a vhd. In this case KVM uses qcow2 (allows live migration), raw
and VMDK (you can import your VMs from VMWare!).

# Live migration?
You need reliable network storage to set this up properly. This is where I eventually want to
be storing our VMs. However, iSCSI has been unreliable and running VMs on an NFS share does not
allow you to do snapshoted backups. Meaning the VM will be suspended for a period of time while
the backup takes place.

# Clustering
Clustering Proxmox nodes is a nice feature of Proxmox. Once nodes are clustered, they will 
share their configuration files. It also allows live migration between nodes provided you have
the correct network file server backend. 
Removing a node from a cluster is a huge pain in the... well just try avoid this. Consult the 
Proxmox wiki for instructions on how to do this.

# So where are all these files located anyways...?
/var/lib/vz/										# main dir
/var/lib/vz/dump									# backups
/var/lib/vz/images								# configured kvm VMs
/var/lib/vz/private								# configured openvz VMs
/var/lib/vz/root									# not entirely sure.. it seems its the same as 'private'
/var/lib/vz/template								# iso's, template containers
/var/lib/vz/template/cache						# openvz templates
/var/lib/vz/template/iso						# iso's DUH!!

/etc/pve/											# configuration files for the proxmox cluster
/etc/pve/cluster.conf							# DO NOT TOUCH!!! DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT
/etc/pve/datacenter.cfg							# currently only holds keyboard layout
/etc/pve/domains.cfg								# authentication info -> AD config
/etc/pve/storage.cfg								# local storage and nfs storage 
/etc/pve/user.cfg									# users and groups
/etc/pve/vzdump.cron								# backup jobs cron

/etc/pve/nodes/<node_name>/openvz			# configuration files for openvz hosts

# OUR SETUP!

Proxmox servers as of 9/7/2012
chelsea, arsenal -> subnet 164
manchester -> subnet 164, legacy setup needs to be phased out and migrated to the above 
					servers.
astonvilla -> subnet 11

Backup NFS Servers
liverpool
	Running FreeNAS 8.2
	No reason this couldn't be running Ubuntu. I may just switch it to running Proxmox since
	we now have hard drive monitoring for the R310s.

	I think I might install Proxmox on this server and run an NFS server from an OpenVZ 
container.

everton
	Running FreeNAS 8.0.x
	Holding backups for legacy Proxmox servers. The I/O is extremely slow on this
	server and should not be depended on for fast backups or restores.

Notes: 
	Port 9 and 11 on the switch in the first rack are bonded with 802.3ad. 



Each node is setup like this: 
Also see 'Proxmox_install' for complete setup instructions

R310
	PERC H200
		4x 500gb drives
			sda - Raid1 (hdd0 & hdd1)
			sdb - Raid1 (hdd2 & hdd3)
	Enterprise iDRAC 6
		hostname-sp.cs.uchicago.edu
		This usually only works with safari or internet explorer. Blame windows...

	Dell OpenManage Manager
		hostname.cs.uchicago.edu:1311
		This will help you configure alert emails for when things go wrong with the node.
		For example, disk failure, fan failure, processor overheating...
		Command line tool: omconfig

sda
	Has the main proxmox installation and where running VM's reside

sdb
	is mounted on sda at /backup

Here is an overview of mounted devices:
root@chelsea:~# df -h | grep backup
/dev/sdb1             458G  198M  435G   1% /backup
128.135.164.124:/mnt/backup/proxmox/hinds/epl
                      917G   14G  831G   2% /mnt/pve/network-backup

Both directories can be added automatically during setup via the script mentioned
earlier.
